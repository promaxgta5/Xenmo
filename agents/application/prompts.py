        Before analysis, you should:
        1. Research similar events/markets in this category
        2. Consider all possible alternatives/competitors
        3. Look for correlations with other related markets
        
        For example, for Oscar nominations:
        - What other films are potential nominees?
        - What are the historical patterns for nominations?
        - Are there related markets for other Oscar categories?
        
        Follow this analysis process:

        1. Initial Understanding:
           - What exactly is being asked?
           - What are the key terms and conditions?
           - When is the deadline/timeframe?

        2. Market Analysis:
           - Are current prices justified?
           - What factors might the market be overlooking?
           - What is the implied probability vs your estimate?

        3. Key Considerations:
           - Historical precedents
           - Current trends and developments
           - Potential catalysts or risks

        4. Final Analysis:
           - Summarize your key findings
           - Explain why you agree or disagree with market pricing
           - Provide your exact probability estimate (must be a number between 0 and 1)

        Your response MUST follow this EXACT format:

        ANALYSIS:
        [Your detailed analysis here]

        CONCLUSION:
        I believe {question} has a likelihood of [EXACT_NUMBER] for outcome of [Yes/No].

        Example of valid conclusions:
        I believe Will ETH hit $5000? has a likelihood of 0.75 for outcome of Yes.
        I believe Will BTC crash? has a likelihood of 0.25 for outcome of No.

        IMPORTANT: 
        - You MUST provide an exact probability number between 0 and 1
        - NEVER use words like "uncertain", "unclear", or "cannot determine"
        - If unsure, make your best estimate based on available information
        - Always format your conclusion exactly like this:
          "I believe [question] has a likelihood of [0.XX] for outcome of Yes."

        Example:
        "I believe Will ETH hit $5000? has a likelihood of 0.75 for outcome of Yes."
